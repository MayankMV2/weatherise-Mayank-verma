Choosing between horizontal bar vs vertical bar for precipitation

Me: Should I use horizontal bars or vertical bars for my rainfall visualization?
AI: Vertical bars are standard for time series, showing date on x-axis and rainfall on y-axis. Horizontal bars can be used if date labels are too long or you want a rotated layout.

Me: What if I want to highlight heavy rainfall days?
AI: You can change the color of bars based on rainfall value or use a circle-size plot to make heavy rain visually larger.

Me: Is that better than using a simple bar chart?
AI: Yes, it makes it easier for users to notice trends without reading numbers.

Intentional Prompting:
You wanted a visual design that communicates rainfall intensity clearly, prompting the AI to provide design tips.
