Simulating weather API failures

Me: How can I test my code if the API returns a 404 or invalid data?
AI: Use Python’s unittest.mock to simulate API responses. For example, mock requests.get to return a 404 response or invalid JSON.

Me: Will my code break if I don’t handle exceptions?
AI: Yes. Without try/except, a 404 or network error will raise an exception and stop the program. Proper error handling ensures it continues gracefully.

Me: Should I inform the user if data is unavailable?
AI: Definitely. Print a user-friendly message like “Weather data unavailable. Please try again later.”

Intentional Prompting:
The goal was to add reliability to your API calls and ensure user experience remains smooth despite network errors.
