Exploring alternative Python plotting libraries

Me: Is there a better Python library than matplotlib for making interactive weather graphs?
AI: Yes, libraries like Plotly or Bokeh can create interactive charts where users can hover over points, zoom in/out, and see real-time updates.

Me: Would using Plotly complicate my assignment?
AI: Not much. Plotly has a similar API to matplotlib. The main difference is that you may need to install it (pip install plotly) and call fig.show() instead of plt.show().

Me: Should I switch to Plotly or stick to matplotlib for my assignment?
AI: For a student project, matplotlib is sufficient. If you want interactivity as a bonus feature, you could try Plotly.

Intentional Prompting:
The goal was to explore interactive plotting options and weigh simplicity versus advanced features. You prompted the AI to ensure the recommendation fits the project scope.
