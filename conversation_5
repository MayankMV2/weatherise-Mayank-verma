Validating user input with pyinputplus

Me: I want to make sure users enter a valid menu option for my Weather Advisor. Is pyinputplus better than input()?
AI: Yes. PyInputPlus automatically validates input, and you can restrict allowed values using inputChoice.

Me: What if they type letters when numbers are expected?
AI: PyInputPlus will re-prompt them until a valid choice is entered, preventing crashes.

Me: Can I set a timeout or default value?
AI: Yes. For example, pyip.inputChoice(['1','2','3'], timeout=10, default='1') will select option 1 if no input is given within 10 seconds.

Intentional Prompting:
You ensured the input method is robust and user-friendly for your menu system, avoiding invalid inputs during testing.
