# üå¶Ô∏è WeatherWise ‚Äî Python Weather Advisor

## üìò Overview

**WeatherWise** is a simple Python-based application designed to provide current weather updates using the **wttr.in API**.  
It allows users to view daily forecasts, ask weather-related questions in natural language, and explore weather data through interactive graphs.  
This project was developed as part of an academic exercise to demonstrate modular coding practices, API integration, and AI-supported software development.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Retrieves up-to-date weather information via the **wttr.in API**.  
- Handles API errors gracefully and limits forecast data to the next three days.  
- Displays temperature and rainfall statistics using **matplotlib**.  
- Uses **pyinputplus** for reliable and validated user input.  
- Offers a clean, menu-driven command-line interface.  
- Demonstrates how to design AI prompts and integrate learning-oriented code suggestions.

## üß† AI Assistance

The AI assistant (**Perplexity Pro**) contributed to:
- Drafting pseudocode and outlining function structures.  
- Improving API error handling and data retrieval mechanisms.  
- Suggesting modular code organization and visualization methods.  
- Solving issues related to `matplotlib` blocking and runtime interruptions.  
- Assisting with documentation, debugging, and structured prompting techniques.
